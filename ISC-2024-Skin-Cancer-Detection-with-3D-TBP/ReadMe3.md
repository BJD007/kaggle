# Skin Cancer Detection from 3D Total Body Photos (TBP)

This project aims to develop an image-based algorithm to differentiate histologically confirmed malignant skin lesions from benign ones using single-lesion crops from 3D Total Body Photos (TBP). The model is trained to predict the probability of malignancy for each lesion, which could help in triage and early detection of skin cancer.

## Project Overview

Skin cancer can be deadly if not detected early, especially in populations lacking access to specialized dermatologic care. This project leverages a novel dataset of cropped lesion images from 3D TBP to develop an AI algorithm that can help in early skin cancer detection in non-clinical settings.

## Dataset

The dataset includes diagnostically labeled images along with metadata. The images are provided as JPEGs, and a CSV file contains binary diagnostic labels (`target`) along with other metadata fields like age, sex, and anatomical site.

- **Train Data**: Images and metadata for training.
- **Test Data**: Images and metadata for testing, with a placeholder submission format.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04
- **Python**: Python 3.x

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/skin-cancer-detection-tbp.git
   cd skin-cancer-detection-tbp
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### CUDA Support (Optional)

If you plan to use GPU for training with CUDA support, ensure you have the correct CUDA version installed. Adjust the `torch` and `torchvision` versions in `requirements.txt` as needed.

## Running the Code

### Training

To train the model on the provided dataset, run:

```bash
python train.py --data_dir /path/to/train-data --output_dir /path/to/save/model
python3 train.py --data_dir /home/bhaskarhertzwell/Documents/Bhaskar_GITHUB/kaggle/ISIC-2024 - Skin-Cancer-Detection-with-3D-TBP/data/train-image/image --output_dir /home/bhaskarhertzwell/Documents/Bhaskar_GITHUB/kaggle/ISIC-2024 - Skin-Cancer-Detection-with-3D-TBP/models
```

### Inference

To run inference on the test dataset and generate predictions, run:

```bash
python inference.py --model_path /path/to/saved/model --test_dir /path/to/test-data --output_file submission.csv
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate the model on a validation set or during training, run:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/saved/model --val_dir /path/to/validation-data
```
