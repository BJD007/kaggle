Here's how you can structure your Kaggle competition project into a GitHub repository. Below is the complete code, including data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, and submission. I'll also include instructions on how to structure the repository.

```

### 1. Dataset and DataLoader (`dataset.py`)

### 2. Model Architecture (`model.py`)


### 3. Utility Functions (`utils.py`)

### 4. Training Script (`train.py`)


### 5. Inference and Submission Script (`inference.py`)
```python

```

### 6. Requirements File (`requirements.txt`)

### 7. README File (`README.md`)

# Skin Cancer Detection with 3D TBP

This repository contains the code for participating in the Kaggle competition focused on detecting histologically confirmed skin cancer using 3D total body photography (TBP) images.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `models/`: Contains the trained model.
- `notebooks/`: Contains exploratory data analysis notebooks.
- `scripts/`: Contains the core scripts for data loading, model training, and inference.
- `submission.csv`: The final submission file for Kaggle.
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download and place the dataset in the `data/` directory.
4. Run the training script: `python scripts/train.py`.
5. Generate predictions: `python scripts/inference.py`.
6. Submit the `submission.csv` file to Kaggle.

### Instructions for GitHub
1. **Create a new repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skin-cancer-detection.git
   ```
3. **Copy the above project structure** and files into the cloned repository.
4. **Add, commit, and push** the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit with full project structure"
   git push origin main
   ```

This setup will allow you to manage your project effectively and easily submit your work to Kaggle. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
