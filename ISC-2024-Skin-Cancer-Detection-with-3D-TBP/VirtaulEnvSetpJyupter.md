To set up a virtual environment specifically for use with Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Python and `virtualenv`
- Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can check by running:
  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```
- Install `virtualenv` if you don't have it installed already:
  ```bash
  pip3 install virtualenv
  ```

### Step 2: Create a Project Directory
- Create and navigate to the directory for your new project:
  ```bash
  mkdir my_project
  cd my_project
  ```

### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment
- Create a virtual environment inside your project directory:
  ```bash
  virtualenv venv
  ```
  - `venv` is the name of the virtual environment folder.

### Step 4: Activate the Virtual Environment
- **On Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **On macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 5: Install Jupyter Notebook
- With the virtual environment activated, install Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  pip3 install jupyter
  ```

### Step 6: Install Project Dependencies
- Install any additional Python libraries you need for your project:
  ```bash
  pip3 install numpy pandas matplotlib
  ```

### Step 7: Add the Virtual Environment to Jupyter Notebook
- Install the `ipykernel` package, which allows you to add your virtual environment as a kernel in Jupyter:
  ```bash
  pip3 install ipykernel
  ```
- Add the virtual environment to Jupyter as a new kernel:
  ```bash
  python -m ipykernel install --user --name=my_project_env --display-name "Python (my_project_env)"
  ```
  - `--name` specifies the internal name of the kernel.
  - `--display-name` is what you'll see in the Jupyter Notebook interface when selecting a kernel.

### Step 8: Start Jupyter Notebook
- Launch Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- When creating a new notebook or changing the kernel in an existing one, select "Python (my_project_env)" to use the virtual environment.

### Step 9: Deactivate the Virtual Environment
- When youâ€™re done working, deactivate the virtual environment:
  ```bash
  deactivate
  ```

### Step 10: Reactivate the Environment Later
- To reactivate the environment for use with Jupyter, follow the same steps as before:
  - **Windows**:
    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - **macOS/Linux**:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### Summary
These steps ensure that your Jupyter Notebook runs within the isolated environment of your project, keeping dependencies and packages separate from other projects. This setup is especially useful when working on multiple projects with differing package requirements.
