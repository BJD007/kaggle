### Steps to Install in Ubuntu 20.04

1. **Update and upgrade your system:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Install Python 3 and pip (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-pip -y
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:**
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### CUDA Compatibility (Optional)
If you're using a GPU with CUDA support, ensure that the correct CUDA version is installed. You can modify the `torch` and `torchvision` versions based on your CUDA version. For Ubuntu 20.04, you can typically use CUDA 11.x series. To install CUDA:

1. **Install CUDA Toolkit:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit -y
   ```

2. **Verify the CUDA installation:**
   ```bash
   nvcc --version
   ```

3. **Check your CUDA version and select the correct PyTorch version.** The provided `requirements.txt` assumes CUDA 11.7 (`cu117`). If you use a different version, update the `torch` and `torchvision` lines accordingly.

This setup should work well for your project environment on Ubuntu 20.04.
